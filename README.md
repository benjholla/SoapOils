# SoapOils

A library of soap oil properties. Archive populated using data from soapeee.com just before the April 2024 shutdown.

## Properties

### Bubbly
This is a measure of how much loose, fluffy lather is produced. A "bubbly" lather is produced quickly by a soap, but doesn't last long

Recommended: 14-46 %

### Cleansing
It is a measure of how water soluble the soap is -- meaning it is a measure of how easily the soap dissolves in difficult situations such as hard water, cold water, or salt water. The Cleansing number does NOT tell you whether the soap will actually get your skin clean.

Recommended: 12-22 %

### Condition
The conditioning value is a measure of the soap's ability to soften and soothe the skin. The "anti tight-and-dry" property, so to speak.

Recommended: 44-69 %

### Hardness
The Hardness number is a measure of the physical hardness-like-a-rock. It tells you how relatively easy it will be to unmold a particular soap after saponification. It does NOT necessarily tell you how long-lived the soap will be.

Recommended: 29-54 %

### Longevity
It is a guideline for how long you soap will last. The higher the number the longer lasting the soap. Too low and the soap doesn't last sufficiently long in the shower. Too high and the soap doesn't lather as well.

Recommended: 25-50 %

### Stable
How long the lather will stay fluffy with big bubbles

Recommended: 16-48 %

### Iodine

Recommended: 41-70 %

### Ins

Recommended: 136-165

## Fatty Acids %

### Lauric
A saturated fatty acid which is responsible for big fluffy lather, has good cleansing properties and hardens the bar. On the contrary it's longevity is reduced and the cleansing level is potent enough to be unpleasantly drying

### Linoleic
An unsaturated fatty acid which makes for a soft bar with moisturizing and conditioning qualities but high amounts decrease shelf life (rancidity potential)

### Myristic
A saturated fatty acid which shares features with Lauric Acid as they are commonly found together in oils

### Oleic
An unsaturated fatty acid that contributes to a hard, moisturizing and conditioning bar and improves shelf life (rancidity potential)

### Palmitic
A saturated fatty acid that helps with the longevity and hardness of the bar with stable and creamy lather

### Stearic
A saturated fatty acid which makes for hard bar with stable and creamy lather
